# Portfolio in the form of a web application

Frontend: Using Vue3 + Vite.

Backend: Using NodeJs + Firebase as a database.

Notes:

Project uses vuex store, axios and vue router.
Basic unit testing is being set up.
Plan to include e2e testing using nightwatch in the future.
The application is (currently manually) deployed to herokuapp.com.
Currently this is done via a connection to github, but the plan here is to write a Dockerfile and deploy it using Docker.
